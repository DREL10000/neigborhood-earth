# Neigborhood Earth

## Purpose of this project

**Climate change is accelerating faster than ever**. Human activities like energy use, industry, transportation, and agriculture are releasing greenhouse gases that have already warmed the planet by 1.2°C compared to pre-industrial times. This is driving intense droughts, rising sea levels, wildfires, floods, and biodiversity loss.

Scientists agree that to avoid the worst impacts, we must limit global warming to 1.5°C — yet current policies could lead us to as much as 3.1°C of warming by the end of the century.

To meet this challenge, we need more than just policy — we need people-powered change.

Project Neighborhood Earth is a platform designed to:

- Let people share positive climate actions in their communities

- Promote events aimed at environmental impact

- Crowdfund eco-friendly ideas and projects, empowering everyday people to make a difference

By turning climate awareness into community action, we aim to grow a global neighborhood of change-makers — one good deed at a time.
